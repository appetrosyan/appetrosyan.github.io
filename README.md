# Aleksandr Petrosyan


I'm a Physicist and Software engineer.

I'm proficient in systems programming for Blockchains, Bayesian inference, Transformer-based machine learning, and reinforcement learning.
I have worked on crypto-heavy and highly concurrent environments, with a significant overlap with compiler construction and virtual machines.
I have led the development of Hyperledger Iroha v2, since 2021 to 2023.

This is my personal space. It will contain links to, but will be distinct from my work in collaboration with Greybeard consulting and Greybeard Entertainment, our blogging endeavour.

If you came to this place, you're probably here for my CV.

This site also refers to a collage of projects; things that I've worked on over the years.
