But I&#39;m not, for lack of a better term, an Emacs zealot. If you ask me what editor should you use, the answer isn&#39;t automatically, or often, Emacs. The zealots believe that it is enough to cite the power, and the relatively low skill floor for Emacs to be an optimal choice, but I would say that I disagree vehemently. I&#39;ve even written about it (hint: look in the <strong>rants</strong> section).</p><p>However, for a large portion of the population, Emacs is the right choice. If you&#39;re a tinkerer, a programmer, a writer, or generally someone who is not afraid of doing something unconventional, it might be a good fit. I say <em>might</em> instead of <em>is</em>; Emacs is not universally good.</p><p>If you, however, do indeed want to try it, I think there is quite a bit of misinformation out there; enough for me to write out an article to correct as many misconceptions as I can. I do think that a lot of people that give up on Emacs, do so because of what I can only describe as misaligned expectations, and misleading advice. We can fix both.</p><p>So without further ado.</p><h2 id="we-are-legion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#we-are-legion"><span>We are legion</span></a></h2><p>Starting out with Emacs is quite a daunting task, in the same way as starting out with GNU/Linux distributions. There&#39;s multiple choices, they are not distinct enough to be pigeonholed into a niche and as a consequence the user is faced with analysis paralysis. Unlike most GNU Linux distributions, however, you can&#39;t go wrong with either of the distributions. You can later amend your choice, but the best starting point is perhaps to not worry and <em>just pick one</em>.</p><p>Some people will argue in favour of pure GNU Emacs that comes with your package manager. Indeed that is what I use personally. Some people will argue that if you&#39;re on MacOS, something like <code>emacs-mac</code> or better yet, a distribution such as Spacemacs, or Aquamacs is going to be better for you. They are not wrong. Some people swear by Doom Emacs. And they are not stupid. Each distribution offers you a different set of defaults, and a somewhat different method of obtaining Emacs packages. That&#39;s really the extent of it. The distributions sometimes leapfrog the core, and sometimes the core benefits from a more concerted effort.</p><p>Unlike with the <code>vi</code> family of editors, there are no radical differences. All distributions are configured in Elisp, and all versions, including &quot;vanilla&quot; Emacs, are batteries-included and completely usable without any additional packages installed. Emacs comes with <code>org</code> for outline editing, <code>tex</code> for LaTeX <em>et al.</em> as well as major modes for most if not all programming languages that support both a regex-based highlighting, and an experimental <code>tree-sitter</code> based parser-based highlighting. If you know what to activate, you can do a shocking amount of things with just the base installation of Emacs.</p><p>Emacs can benefit greatly from knowing its configuration language -- Elisp. But you don&#39;t actually have to know it in order to use many of the editor&#39;s facilities. You can install and configure packages without ever leaving the comfort of a guided widget-ed GUI environment. The actual appearance is sub-optimal, but that is something that can, and most likely <em>shall</em> be fixed.</p><p>If you go to the opposite extreme, a version-controlled, literate configuration in the <code>org</code> format, containing much programmatical configuration; that too is common. Most, but not all programmers have an <code>init.org</code>. Most if not all programmers utilise the now built-in <code>use-package</code>, which as of Emacs 30 has support for installing any version controlled package; a great help if you yourself are prototyping. Some programmers have a large collection of personal snippets of code tailored to one&#39;s particular workflow. Some do none of that. Both approaches are equally valid. You can only find out which camp you belong to after having tried it.</p><p>With that said, there is a small cheat sheet that can help you out. If in doubt, just go with the &quot;vanilla&quot; Emacs that ships with your distribution. Don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s an older version, or doesn&#39;t have the new-fangled &quot;pure GTK&quot; render; hell even if it looks like a windows 3.x program, it&#39;s probably installed with the <code>lucid</code> toolkit and that offers better latency and generally is less buggy if used as a server. Don&#39;t feel pressured to choose a different version, just because someone else uses it.</p><p>If you have a bit of baggage, like you already used <code>vi</code> or the <code>vim</code> modes of different editors, you can still benefit greatly from using &quot;vanilla&quot; Emacs. For one, it&#39;s easy to install the emulation packages and there&#39;s one already built-in. A second, more philosophical reason is that Emacs has great customisation facilities. For the right person, going with Doom Emacs, might take away the fun of discovering and modding one program to behave exactly to spec.</p><p>Plain emacs on Mac OS seems to work well these days. Native compilation is a tricky subject at the time of writing, because of the fact that <code>libgccjit</code> is written with x86 processors by default, and newer mac machines all use ARM. It&#39;s a minor inconvenience, however. Not having native compilation does not necessarily result in a vastly inferior experience, it is a <em>nice to have</em>, rather than a <em>must have</em>.</p><p>So basic Emacs works fine. Go for it. Distributions work fine too. Pick one and don&#39;t worry. That&#39;s not as important as the zealots would make you think.</p><h2 id="the-paths-are-many" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-paths-are-many"><span>The paths are many</span></a></h2><p>This is kind of an important point that is often overlooked. Having installed the program on your machine, there are multiple paths that you can take, and all of them yield a different kind of chance of success for different kinds of people. Namely, for a writer and non-technical person, starting with just learning to open files with <code>Ctrl+x Ctrl+f</code> and interpreting <code>C-x C-f</code> as that combination, is an important first step. Learn to work with that.</p><p>You should learn that <code>ESC</code> acts as a one-shot modifier for the next keybinding, so <code>ESC x</code> is the same as <code>Alt+X</code> is the same as <code>M-x</code>. You should know that <code>Ctrl+g</code> or <code>ESC ESC ESC</code> gets you out of whatever sticky situation you found yourself in, including a weird layout.</p><p>There are some historical idiosyncrasies that I disagree with, but that are here to stay, like the fact that <code>C-m</code> is the same as the return character, in the sense that you cannot rebind the two independently. All that you need to know is that it is no more than a convention, most learn to ignore it, some take advantage, and others, like myself, break that convention, by modifying the <code>input-decode-map</code>.</p><p>Aside from that, there isn&#39;t any required knowledge about conventions. None. The rest of the information is <em>highly</em> contingent on what your workflow looks like and what precisely do you want to accomplish. As such I would give you some pointers as to what I, and a few of my friends found helpful.</p><h3 id="vanilla-all-the-way" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vanilla-all-the-way"><span>Vanilla all the way</span></a></h3><p>The out-of-the-box Emacs experience is shockingly good, for a program its age. A large number of things is included by default, a large number is in better shape than some of the standard packages in <code>neovim</code>, particularly <code>project.el</code> compared to <code>telescope</code>.</p><p>Even if you have no intention of leargning Elisp, Emacs can be beneficial. Emacs has been polished over so many years, that with few exceptions, you will find the defaults to be the best way forward, and the few areas where there ought to be choice, that choice can be made using the built-in <code>customize</code> system.</p><p>So don&#39;t fight it. If you are a complete newbie and a non-technical person (which give the blog that you&#39;re reading, you most likely aren&#39;t, but might know someone who is), just go with the tutorial. Learn to use negative arguments, <code>C-n</code>, <code>C-p</code>, maybe re-map Control to the (in my opinion completely redundant) CAPS LOCK, and that&#39;s it.</p><p>If you go down this route, I think we ought to have a game-ified practice dojo, that would let you ingrain these things as habits, but if we&#39;re completely honest, if you just stick to using Emacs, you&#39;ll pick it up; and even if you don&#39;t that&#39;s perfectly fine too.</p><p>As a long-time user of Emacs, with a large collection of 3-rd party packages, customisations and a few other things, I tell you that using Emacs 30 with no changes is a good enough experience for me. I can still benefit from some strategic elisp, but I find that it is far and away not as important as I thought it would be.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>One important, but often overlooked aspect of Emacs, is that it offers the familiar, IBM CUA bindings available via a menu. If you go to <code>Options</code>, and then tick the &quot;Cut/Paste with <code>C-x</code>,<code>C-v</code>... (CUA mode)&quot; box, you get a <em>very</em> familiar interface to what most people are using in the rest of the operating system.</p><p>Most Emacs coriphei think that this can hamper your growth, and that you shouldn&#39;t do that. I fervently disagree and believe that this is bad advice. This option and mode exist for a reason. If anything it should be made more accessible to the point of being on by default.</p></div><p>Emacs has an extremely active developer community, which is impressive especially for an editor that can trace its lineage back to early Lisp machines. Every new major release comes with significant improvements. I will say that of all the software that I run, this is the main one which gets me excited when a new version is out. So not experimenting with new-fangled third party packages is not necessarily something to worry about. Fear of missing out shouldn&#39;t drive your decisions.</p><p>For most people, even mastering the built-ins is probably good enough and I would urge people to consider using it in that way, so we can improve the experience to newcomers. A particularly important point is the implementation of ease-of-use functionality, like the recent merge of <code>which-key</code>, which displays the currently bound keys on a partial keystroke. The addition of <code>transient</code> allows package developers to create more involved and perhaps better organised interfaces for their packages, which can help a great deal. With time, I can see Emacs becoming more, not less, accessible to the average user.</p><h3 id="light-tinkerer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#light-tinkerer"><span>Light tinkerer</span></a></h3><p>This is an archetype that is most descriptive of someone who has just started computing seriously. They might be in school, or they might be someone who is tired of VSCode, and they want to try something else. This is the most vulnerably demographic, as Emacs can be extremely intimidating, obtuse and perhaps fundamentally broken for these people. Consequently, this is the demographic that would benefit from my advice the most.</p><p>The way you chip away at the Emacs iceberg is largely up to you. Most tinkerers are different enough, for there to be no one good approach. But there are things which can make or break one&#39;s experience, so if you are one of the few at-risk of quitting, here are some tips which should help prevent frustration.</p><p>First, remember that Emacs is primarily a customisable computing environment. Feel free to ignore advice on the internet, if you understand when it applies. This applies to the current article as well, though naturally you should finish reading it first!</p><p>The <strong>most important</strong> skill you can learn is how to control the behaviour of Emacs, that means <em>packages</em>, <em>hooks</em>, <em>functions</em>, <em>key-binds</em>, and <code>customize</code>, but to a far lesser extent, given that your interaction should be primarily through elisp. This implies that you should know how to find new packages, and this is usually best done by browsing forges, and finding aggregators such as <a href="https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emacs-tw Awesome</a>.</p><p>At some point, you will learn to use ELPA directly, and sometimes, but not often, to supplement it via your own code. You see, while conventional wisdom tells you that fragmentation is a bad thing, an alternative take on an existing problem is often the right thing to do. Learn to configure, packages, and you shall have a whole lot more to work with.</p><p>Emacs is conducive to poaching entire snippets out of someone&#39;s dotfiles. This is a practice that I would, normally, highly discourage with <code>neovim</code>. Emacs, is different; largely because <code>use-package</code> is both good, and built-in, unlike <em>e.g.</em> <code>lazy.nvim</code> and other package managers. The package installation, dependencies, <code>autoloads</code>, hooks and bindings are all self-contained. This locality of definition, was what originally sold Steve Jobs and Brendan Eich on Object-Oriented programming. One feature of Lisp, that people re-discovered in other languages, loved, misinterpreted, made ugly, and subsequently turned into an abomination, is its unique ability to modularise by domain, creating tree-like hierarchies.</p><p>The <strong>second most important</strong> skill is how to diagnose breakage. I cannot emphasise how important it is to understand how Emacs differs from other batch-processed editors, <em>e.g.</em> <code>neovim</code> itself. You can load the configuration one balanced symbolic expression at a time, with <code>C-x C-e</code> or with <code>eval-defun</code> bound to a suitably convenient key. You are highly encouraged to put your packages into self-contained <code>use-package</code> forms, because then, if one particular package misbehaves, you can just comment out that particular part and try again.</p><p>Learning how to diagnose problems is also a skill for understanding the dependency relationships between the packages that you have, and the packages that you need to install on your regular system as dependencies for the elisp packages. As a drill, I would suggest breaking something intentionally, and trying to figure out how easy it is to debug. If it&#39;s not, you probably need a bit more practice, or a bit more setup. I used to have the issue of having to bisect my <code>init.el</code> whenever some misbehaving package like <code>jedi</code> caused my configuration to break. The solution was to break it up thematically, and to have redundancy, so that if a particular file failed to load, the others did.</p><p>Finally, learn to read the documentation. It is difficult to fault anyone at this point for not reading the Emacs documentation. Yes, it is highly encouraged to provide documentation for your functions, but the quality is sub-par. The main problem is that Lisp, being different from a compiled statically typed language has a lot of behaviour that is left up to context. One may be surprised that some elisp functions read a global variable&#39;s state. Some communicate their results via a global variable. This is a paradigm that one must learn. It cannot be absorbed passively.</p><p>I would strongly urge light tinkerers to try and read as much documentation as they can. This is particularly important for packages that you use often. Sometimes there are deprecations, and changes, like <em>e.g.</em> <code>define-key</code> being now <code>keymap-set</code>.</p><h3 id="heavy-tinkerers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#heavy-tinkerers"><span>Heavy tinkerers</span></a></h3><p>My only advice here is to try and experiment. It is tempting to assume that you know it all, and sometimes you know better than the package author. But sometimes you don&#39;t. Sometimes, you end up in a position in which the paradigm is counter-intuitive, but you are fundamentally incorrect.</p><p>This is the only category of users for whom it is worthwhile to suggest that they should try and learn using the Emacs keybinds, before they turn on <code>vim</code> emulation or CUA modes.</p><p>As someone who doesn&#39;t like to spend a lot of time configuring my editor, I have heard of some problems with heavy tinkerers wherein they spend a large amount of time experimenting and changing things, when in reality they ought to focus on learning and work. The readers in the audience know it, and they should just refrain from applying their old conventional wisdom.</p><p>One important aspect to learn is that Emacs offers a paradigm that is impossible to replicate in other editors, so if you are coming from something like <code>neovim</code> you should know to do things differently. For example, <code>C-x C-f</code> and <code>C-x p f</code> serve different purposes. They split the functionality that was entwined in <code>telescope</code> and provide two situational niches. Rebinding <code>C-x C-s</code> is not too important, because you have other options; for example, you could enable <code>auto-save-visited-mode</code> and automatically save your progress after a period of inactivity. What I have in my dotfiles is a function <code>full-stop</code> that is triggered once I hit <code>.</code> twice. This cleans up whitespace, runs a <code>langtool</code> check on the buffer, and then saves the buffer too. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. And to obviate the need for a complicated and complex heuristic, the same can be said of version control, and commits.</p><p>Another commonly confusing aspect is that Emacs doesn&#39;t provide a tab bar. Firstly, it does, secondly it doesn&#39;t need to, because the tab bar is fundamentally less efficient than the currently existing interaction model with the buffer selection done via <code>completing-read</code>. It is more efficient, because you can trigger a move to a new buffer from any state with <code>C-x C-b</code> and knowing the first few letters of the buffer&#39;s name. And that same menu is equipped with smart heuristics that allow you to switch in some common use-cases even faster. Switching to the previous buffer is just <code>C-x C-b RET</code>.</p><p>A similar approach works with many other aspects of Emacs, and I will keep detailing them. Suffice it to say, if you think that something is ergonomically non-viable, it is probably because someone has come up with a better option.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated:: </span><time class="meta-item-info" datetime="2025-03-23T16:53:28.000Z" data-allow-mismatch>23/03/2025, 16:53</time></div><div class="vp-meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: ap886@cantab.ac.uk">Aleksandr Petrosyan</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
