<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

<p>I'm a Physicist that pivoted to Rust engineering in 2021. </p>

<p>I am proficient in systems programming for Blockchains.  I have worked both in cryptographically heavy and systems-heavy environments. I specialise in heavy concurrency and compiler/virtual machine construction.  I have done engineering, consulting and lead the Hyperledger Iroha project from 2021 to 2023. </p>

<p>This is my personal space. You probably want to see my CV. This site also contains a collage of my projects; things I've worked on over the years. </p>
