<p>::: tip
A much more detailed guide is going to be published on the Greybeard
blog.  So stay tuned.
:::</p>
<p>This is a bit of a short guide, and it&rsquo;s required to be short for one simple reason.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of advice there on the internet.  A lot of it is correct, but it
comes with an implicit contextual limitation.  The people like Uncle Bob
Martin, Johnathan Blow, and perhaps Casey Muratori, are all referring to
programmers that have intrinsically different levels of experience.</p>
<p>So in a world where everyone and their dog is going to tell you how to program,
and how you should organise your code, I&rsquo;m going to say something
controversial.  Do something.  Break the rules.  Have to return to your own
code years later and see where you evolve to.</p>
<p>Do not ignore advice that comes from your coworkers, because it is needed
specifically for your specific project and it allows your PM, and Tech Lead to
do the things that they need to do, the way that they need to do.  At the same
time, if not specified, organising your code according to some well-known
pattern is good, but don&rsquo;t take it to religious levels.  All advice, if
divorced from the context of its origin is bad.  All advice when applied within
context, is good.  It really is up for debate, whether or not you should care
if the dependency is injected, or it is written in the horrible pattern that
you instinctively lean towards.</p>
<p>But nobody, not even you, knows what the project is going to end up looking
like. And that means that most advice needs to be applied only if the
circumstances of its origin have been instantitated.  This is unlikely to
occur, and thus your approach to coding should look more like the freeform that
you have right now.</p>
<h2 id="clean-code">
  Clean code
  <a class="heading-link" href="#clean-code">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>This book is very contextual.  It influenced a different world, where people
had to work in large teams and follow OOP to the letter.  Now the world has
largely abandoned the OOP ideals, even though technically it never really
espoused the good parts.</p>
<p>But one telling symptom of the fact that uncle Bob&rsquo;s advice is not universal is
the fact that not only is there no way to tell if his advice is needed, there
<strong>can</strong> be no way to tell if his advice worked.  It is similar to how it is
impossible to tell if type systems help with safety, because the process of
making something type safe, and making that very same thing safe in the regular
sense of the word is done up to a point where the program is safe-enough, and
parameters such as the psychiatric health of the programmers that did one or
the other is ignored.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that uncle Bob&rsquo;s advice is total bunk, though many on this list
would say so. I&rsquo;m saying that his advice is situational, and the jury is out
whether it&rsquo;s good.  You may be working on a large Java code base, and thus his
suggestions may be extremely useful.  You may be working on that same Java code
base, where writing a <code>static</code> method in a class of just static methods, i.e. a
module, is going to work just as well if not better.</p>
<h2 id="the-anti-clean-code">
  The anti-clean-code
  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-anti-clean-code">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>This is advice that is largely a reaction to the former principles.  People
have noticed that over-abstraction and over-engineering, even in some simple
cases can lead to confusion on behalf of the compiler.  That is, it won&rsquo;t make
your code as optimal, as it should be if all else were equal.</p>
<p>They tend to confuse that with the lack of value in having a code base where
things are neatly and tidily organised.  I&rsquo;m not criticising the body of work
by Casey Muratori, much as I was not criticising uncle Bob.  I am criticising
people that apply the principles of making the thing go fast regardless of
whether or not it is even sensible to do that, at the cost of making things
harder to read.</p>
<p><strong>To be cristal clear</strong> if you&rsquo;re just starting out to progarm, you asbolutely
should focus on making your code as simple  as possible.  Any abstraction that
you will introduce at this point is going to constitute over-engineering, and
in the <a href="https://youtu.be/tD5NrevFtbU"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous video</a>, Casey demonstrates that
even in simple cases, applying that advice and gaining virtually no extra
clarity is very much in the cards.</p>
<p>What that video does not say, and something that you should be keenly aware of,
is that not all projects re solo projects, where you&rsquo;re the only one that is
going to either write or read the code.  You need to make sure that the code is
understandable to your coworkers, and if they are the Bob Martin clean code
type, you will ask them to do more work when interacting with your code.  It
might run faster, it might be just as slow, but the bugs in that code are going
to be your sole responsibility.  Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want that, and you
definitely don&rsquo;t want that if you&rsquo;re a junior engineer in a project that hired
you on someone else&rsquo;s recommendation.  Even if you don&rsquo;t get fired, the
productivity of the team is what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>::: tip
One other point to be made, is that sometimes abstractions not only don&rsquo;t have
an associated cost, but can sometimes improve the performance of your code.
This is strange, but if you pass a <code>struct</code> instead of several integers, you
let the compiler optimise the layout of memory, and thus do less work at
runtime.  If something is a private memeber of a class, the compiler can do
more things because it knows exactly all of the places where that code is going
to be instantitated.

  Functional

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>This is a somewhat touchy subject, because among my peers I&rsquo;m known as the
&ldquo;functional guy&rdquo;, and many of my friends geek out over type systems and formal
proofs and whatnot.</p>
<p>I will say that being a functional programmer is not an end in and of itself.
One enlightening experience was when I took a close look at Rust, a programming
language that I&rsquo;m writing a book on, and to my surprise found that it was
better designed than Haskell from the perspective of correctness.</p>
<p>These principles work.  Thinking in terms of constant immutable states, and
functions as state transitions is a powerful paradigm for <em>some</em> problems.  The
trouble with this approach is that applying it indiscriminately, results in
code that is just as unreadable as bad imperative code.</p>
<p>There will come a time when you will prefer this style, because of one reason
or another.  But until then, learning how to do the basic algorithms in Knuth&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming&rdquo; is probably the best that you can do.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do">
  What to do
  <a class="heading-link" href="#what-to-do">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just told you not to take anyone&rsquo;s advice; but what <em>do you do</em>? How do
you progress from here?</p>
<p>The first point is that you want to be as keenly aware of your specific
problems.  Write code, and ask people to review it.  Ask them to give
constructive critique.  If all goes well, you will see that your code quality
will naturally improve, without adhering to any declarative principles.  The
only people that you should listen to, are the people that you will have to
listen to, because you&rsquo;d be working with them.</p>
<p>The second point is that we are talking about fundamental mathematically
mandated trade-offs.  Things which absolutely exist, which are debatable and
very likely project-dependent.  If you are not a senior engineer, and let&rsquo;s
face it, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you probably aren&rsquo;t, then practice is going to
give you a bigger leg up than any book.  Go!  Implement a Fibonacci heap.
Implement a 2D game with pathfinding.  Do it all in C or in assembly, or do it
in JavaScript.  Nobody will care how you do it, as long as you do it.  The
dialogue about how to best approach a certain problem will be, as it should be,
internal.</p>
<p>When you are in a position in which your code needs to be reviewed by others,
keep in mind that some of the advice about clean code is going to be very
useful, within the context of the following values:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your manager needs your code to be correct.  That means that if it does the
right thing, even if it&rsquo;s much too slow, you can cover it with unit tests, and
it will be good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your manager needs your code to only have obvious bugs.  If something is
much too complicated to wrap your head around and people will use your code
incorrectly, it&rsquo;s your fault. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s over-abstracted, or
under-abstracted, if it&rsquo;s like OpenGL or Vulkan, if the way it&rsquo;s arranged leads
to problems, means that you need to react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your code needs to have good performance characteristics.  More often than
not this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to use some fancy techniques with custom
allocators, but simple things like picking the right datastructure, doing as
much work in-place as you possibly can, and making sure that you&rsquo;re not
blocking anything.  As a good example of why the latter is importnat, Emacs,
the editor that I had to shelve, is perceived as slow, because it is single
threaded and any complex operation (of which modern editors do many), results
in a perceivable slowdown of the editor.  Making your code amenable to AVX and
other fancy CPU-specific architectural optimisations always comes by making
sure your code is readable first.  What that means is another topic, because
readable within the realm of abstractions and decomposable into simple operations
are two different often incompatible things.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So in conclusion, what should you do?</p>
<p>Code.  Make that code publicly available.  Make sure that the people that you trust
can review and give advice.  Apply that advice, make sure that you understand it.</p>
<p>Move on to the next project.  Code.   Repeat.</p>
