      <title>Language elitism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;::: info&#xA;I must preface this by pointing to something that should be blindingly obvious, but shall be taken out of context regardless.  This is not a personal attack on Drew De Vault.  While one might construe our relationship as antagonistic I have respect for a lot of what he is doing.  We are of differing and in some ways incompatible political views, and have different approaches to programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the very object of the following text is to mock antagonism with such flimsy footing.  The subject of the mockery is language elitism, conveyed through the lens of a frustrated rant by Drew De Vault, and demonstrated as a deconstruction of the &amp;ldquo;destruction&amp;rdquo;.  I will posit that all attempts to espouse such an opinion for any reason is fundamentally misguided.&#xA;:::&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Markdown considered harmful</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had complaints about Markdown for years. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. Is it better than e.g. writing your code in ReST, I&amp;rsquo;d argue marginally, and only if you assume that ReST was meant to be used in the same circumstances as Markdown, which it does not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, if your life revolves around Markdown, this article will make your life a bit easier, not by a lot, but still. I&amp;rsquo;d make the case that we&amp;rsquo;re better off leaving Markdown behind, and instead to move beyond &amp;ldquo;lightweight&amp;rdquo; text-based markup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs, the editor for the ages</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/rants/emacs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a blog post dedicated to my, and many other people&amp;rsquo;s favourite text editor. In-keeping with the theme of this section, I shall mainly focus on the misunderstood nature of the editor, and my personal connection to it. Most of it is going to be in the negative light, so it slightly edges out being posted in the Software section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without further ado.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;&#xA;  About me&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#about-me&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like a hostage.&#xA;This is not something that I can &amp;hellip; for lack of a better word admit to lightly.&#xA;Emacs is a tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve invested into heavily.&#xA;The problem is however that I have some long-standing pain points that I hope can someday be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
