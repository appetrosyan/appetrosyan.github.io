      <description>&lt;p&gt;::: info&#xA;I must preface this by pointing to something that should be blindingly obvious, but shall be taken out of context regardless.  This is not a personal attack on Drew De Vault.  While one might construe our relationship as antagonistic I have respect for a lot of what he is doing.  We are of differing and in some ways incompatible political views, and have different approaches to programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the very object of the following text is to mock antagonism with such flimsy footing.  The subject of the mockery is language elitism, conveyed through the lens of a frustrated rant by Drew De Vault, and demonstrated as a deconstruction of the &amp;ldquo;destruction&amp;rdquo;.  I will posit that all attempts to espouse such an opinion for any reason is fundamentally misguided.&#xA;:::&lt;/p&gt;</description>
