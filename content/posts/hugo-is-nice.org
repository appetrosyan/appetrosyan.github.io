I quite like hugo.  It lets me do much more than either Vitepress or Vuepress let me do and I got a fully functional website in a fraction of the time that it would take me to create a Vuepress site.

Are there limitations?  Yes.  Unfortunately there are various things that I do not know what they get rendered to:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This example, for example
#+END_EXAMPLE

I do believe that it is much more prominent.

I quite like the way that it works[fn:1].  I quite like the way that other things work.  Maybe bibliography will work out of the box[fn:2], but maybe not.

* Footnotes
[fn:1]This is quite fun, footnotes took a lot of effort to be added to vuepress.  But their display is a bit odd to say the least.

[fn:2]I hadn't tested it yet.
