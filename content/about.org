#+TITLE: About me

I am a the CEO of Greybeard consulting.  I have written much content in our blog.  We have consulted a few companies mostly in the Web3 space.  This list is intentionally sparse, as I'd prefer that you visit [[https://greybeard.consulting/][our site.]]

I'm currently leading the performance engineering team at [[https://www.eclipse.xyz/][Eclipse Laboratories Inc]].  I've previously led the development of [[https://iroha.tech/][Hyperledger Iroha v2]].  Before then, I had been a moderately successful Physicist, and I occasionally do try to keep up on that.

I'm an avid supporter of Free Software and was previously an associate member of the FSF.  The current political climate and recent witch hunts led me to decide that I can work on free software more directly.  Specifically I contribute to GNU Emacs, and am the author of some packages.  More on that in the projects page.
