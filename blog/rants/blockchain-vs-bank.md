# Preface

This is an interesting discussion with many people that have in one way or another echoed the point of view that cryptocurrencies in general are a blight on society.  While a wiser man than I cautioned against accepting the premise of the bully, in this case doing so is instrumental in dismantling the arguments.

Participation in the cryptocurrencies is voluntary.  As any emerging technology it had some rough edges, and when compared to the recurring economical fiascos of the traditional banking system, blockchains have demonstrated a profound improvement in some areas, and problematic behaviours in others were not.

This resulted in a large amount of so-called intellectuals such as the self-proclaimed systems programmer Drew DeVault, to write scathing articles disclaiming any relationship with crypto.

The one of interest to us, is the following rant that has a half-digested semblance of an idea wrapped in profuse uncritical "technology bad" rhetoric that is somewhat understandably accepted by the community, as Drew tends to have "good reasons" for these vents.  I do so from time to time.  I have a space for it; you're reading the article in the somewhat hard-to-get-to _rants_ section of the blog.  The idea being that I need to publish my thoughts to silence the inner critic.  This doesn't seem to be the case with Drew.

Because of the abject stupidity and negativity of his article, there is a collapsible and collapsed-by-default dislaimer that reads as the following:
<details>
<summary> A personal note </summary>
This rant has been a long time coming and is probably one of the most justified expressions of anger I've written for this blog yet. However, it will probably be the last one.

I realize that my blog has been a source of a lot of negativity in the past, and I regret how harsh I've been with some of the projects I've criticised. I will make my arguments by example going forward: if I think we can do better, I'll do it better, instead of criticising those who are just earnestly trying their best.

Thanks for reading ð Let's keep making the software world a better place.
</details>

While it is tempting to assume that this is a heartfelt apology from an engineer under too much pressure, with undue problems that he didn't sign up to fix, it is also completely disingenuous.  With the clear understanding of the fact that arguments by example are better, but without any semblance of understanding why that is, Drew has continued to spew vitriol at projects tangentially related to his work and causing him problems.  If I did the same, this section would have been perhaps 10 times larger.  The few examples that he has provided can be easily disproven by looking at sources, that is _other than wikipedia_.


# Disclaimer for a disclaimer

Despite the fact that I have no respect for Drew, I will indulge in his request to expose my "stake" in cryptocurrencies: 32k's worth of stablecoins.  I have around ten times that amount locked in other assets, my net worth being modest compared to his, with a small proportion of it kept in Cryptocurrencies.

The reason for this blatant violation of privacy is to demonstrate that anyone of my kind is a lying grifter.  Easier to tell based on my stake.

</quote>

I am someone who is positive about cryptocurrency.  I don't need a "bigger fool" to make my money back, because the value of a stablecoin is tied to the value of the fiat currency, in my case USD, as a result, I can happily live with the liquidity that is available.

Oh and by the way, the reason I have this amount of cryptocurrency is two-fold: I need it to send money to a friend of mine, who most banks consider a scammer, and make my life more difficult, and I have it, because for some time, sending money from my employer to me was problematic, because of the broken banking system, that doesn't seem to think that it needs to put on a veneer of customer satisfaction anymore.

Are there people that invest into a Ponzi scheme and need a bigger fool?  Yes.  Some of them, are using cryptocurrencies for that, but the historical majority used any technology that was available.  Unfortunately, this includes the so-called fight against climate change, that instead of focusing on the real culprits, blame those who have neither a say, nor a choice in the matter.  It would seem preposterous to use that as a weapon against those few that are genuinely trying to do the right thing.

"Maybe your cryptocurrency is different. But look: you're in really poor company. When you're the only honest person in the room, maybe you should be in a different room. It is impossible to trust you. "
</quote>

It is far easier to generalise when you seem to have the moral high ground.  It would have been easy to remind Drew of the error of his ways simply by pointing out the groups of dubious intent and conduct that he has been part of.  He does not seem to believe that being a moderator at a paedophile forum makes one a paedophile and fundamentally untrustworthy, so he can't possibly believe that being in a poor company necessarily means that you should give up.

Him being a co-creator of free software does not automatically make him culpable of the sins that he so-happily points out in the leaders of that foundation, curiously omitting actual problems of funds being siphoned into dead-end projects, lack of transparency, preoccupation with activism, instead of building actually good software, no just the social awkwardness, and sexual misconduct that would never even approximate enough evidence for a lawsuit.

Similarly, he does not believe that he should accept responsibility for the projects hosted on source hut; there will certainly be malware there, that is treated better than cryptocurrencies and/or blockchain technology.  Does his contributions to `wlroots` make him an enabler of `hyprland` and transitively responsible for `vaxry`'s angry outbursts?  That is silly and that's the point; _reductio ad absurdum_ as it is called in philosophy textbooks is at work.

Drew seems to believe that the people who designed BitCoin or Ethereum should be held responsible for the crypto scams; this is not evidenced in the text of his rant...  I'm sorry, it is practically spelled out in this exact phrasing...  OK, that makes my life simpler... let me start again.

Drew believes that just because it is possible to use cryptocurrencies for scams (as it is possible to do so with neural networks, phones, banks, credit, paper documents, paper money, and free software), that this immediately devalues all cryptocurrencies and people that work designing blockchain technology should be ashamed.  This is not a straw man argument, this is the text of the previous quote.  Drew extols the second infinity that Einstein mentioned in the famous quote; it is the one that Einstein was confident was actually infinite.


## Casus belli

The reason why Drew has had his knickers in a twist this particular time is because crypto has enabled a peculiar type of abuse.  One can use computational resources, to "mine" proof-of-work coins.  It is not the intended use, and from his perspective an abuse, CI services that he provides are paid for by him and are meant to be used for building software on his platform.  His dissatisfaction is understandable; it is mathematically impossible to tell what the CPU is used for, so the consequence of that was uncharacteristically eloquently put by Drew himself:

<quote>
Someone found a way of monetizing stolen CPU cycles directly, so everyone who offered free CPU cycles for legitimate use-cases is now unable to provide those services.  If not for cryptocurrency, these services would still be available.
</quote>

It is unfortunate.  It mirrors the arms race of adblockers and internet advertising, and targeted advertising and search engines.  I would accuse Drew of letting ads go easy, but I don't think that he considers them worthy of his attention.  And that is ok.  Ads don't negatively impact hundreds of people while being comparable to several countries worth of emissions, universally reviled and largely a solution to no problem.  This is an oversimplification of course, but advertising would be a bigger target, to anyone who is not just post hoc justifying their distaste; which Drew of course counters with a link to wikipedia on whataboutism.

While I could counter with more finesse, I don't feel the need to.  Simply put, the non-rentability of an older business model is a fact of life.  YouTube is tightening its monetisation strategies for the same reasons as you had to fight for your CI: times change, new technologies make the previously possible impossible.

Enough about that.  The blog post is mercifully short, and bookends with much vitriol.  Like a chimpanze throwing faeces at zoo attendees behind a glass pane, the damage is largely psychological.  Unfortunately, in this metaphor I am the zookeeper that has to occasionally calm the overly enthusiastic chimp down; reminding myself that we are not too different, despite the gulf in intelligence and self-control.  I do not wish to harm Drew, nor do I have any hope of magically advancing his mental faculties to a level wherein he would stop.  Continuing to dissect his poorly argued articles is in fact equivalent to stooping to his level, and I have no desire to do so.

I do however, have the unenviable job of wiping the faeces off the glass pane, to advocate for my work: blockchains.  Drew speaks with such conviction and is involved in so many projects that his opinion can be confused with facts, and I must clarify what he and so many others have muddied.


# What blockchains are

Blockchains are simply a different way of organising data.  It confers some advantages in some cases.  It has its drawbacks in others.  It is an evolving technology with much work still ahead of us.  Cryptocurrencies, as any technology can be used for good or ill, and has historically had its darker side in the spotlight.

## Decentralisation

The chief advantage of an economic system such as Bitcoin is that it does not and cannot have a centralised authority that can override major decisions.  It is global, democratic and egalitarian.  Your bitcoin if you are a citizen in Africa is worth as much as a bitcoin for a citizen of the United States.  It is produced in small quantities, there is a limited amount available, and while those who have greater concentrations of hardware can mine bitcoin at a higher rate, there are no positive laws that prevent anyone else from mining their own bitcoin, albeit less efficiently.  Not one authority can increase the rate of mining of bitcoin, without also investing into a technological breakthrough.

If this all sounds like a _cliche_ you have not considered how many of these statements are true of any one _fiat_ currency.  Not one currently existing currency has all of these properties; in fact, there isn't one that has even half of them.  The US dollar is probably the closest to a global _fiat_ currency, unless you happen to be in one of a few countries that happens to be on bad terms with the US.  It is not democratic, in the sense that the US government can unilaterally decide to mint more dollars, and also to decide not to.  Minting one's own _fiat_ currency is considered a _felony_ in most places.  Decisions are largely made via an opaque process, with little involvement (if any) of the common people.  The amount of _fiat_ currency in circulation is most likely only known to the authority that minted all of it.  The total amount of _fiat_ objects is unlimited, can be denominated at will, and through a phenomenon known as hyperinflation has led to large-scale humanitarian crises.

## Proof-of-work blockchains

Bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency, but it is the single largest target, due to being rigid, and having multiple fundamental flaws that cannot be remedied.  Specifically, BitCoin is known as a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, where one's voting power is proportional to one's labour.

That labour needs to be verifiable, and electronic and must also be possible to apportion into smaller packets known as coins.  To do so, the work must be cryptographic in nature.

The amount of work that needs to be done to enable a certain amount of value varies from blockchain to blockchain.  Because of a miscalculation in how it was set up, the original intent behind BitCoin was that it would be used more as a currency, and less as a way of monetising sheer capacity to do cryptographic work.  Unfortunately, due to differences outlined in the previous section, bitcoin was seen as a competitor to _fiat_ currencies, one that took away power from the world's governments, and as such, the natural elements of its evolution were forestalled, while the rest of its meteoric rise continued.

This created an imbalanced set of incentives and a chain reaction resulting in the two mining booms of 2016 and 2020.  While the media were somewhat uncharitable, to the event, blaming bitcoin miners for shortages of GPUs and other components, such an event was far from the intended use of cryptocurrencies.

As such, proof of work blockchains, and cryptocurrencies based in those blockchains are largely going extinct.  Despite this, the popular perception is still that blockchains are universally power-hungry, a sentiment that is echoed by a certain individual whose name was given enough limelight.  As such, I believe that it is imperative that we evaluate the claim.

For simplicity we shall assume that all such research is reported and done in good faith; a claim that ignores the gulf in the detail, and does not pass the regular person's experience check, but one that I will indulge in.  Specifically, let us examine [the article that](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00086-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435122000861%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#mmc1) is cited in Wikipedia as the study that estimated the bitcoin's total power consumption at a fraction of a percent of the global power consumption: with  117.27 TWh presumably over the period preceding August 2021.  Ironically the article is merely a demonstration of China's government intervention forcing bitcoin miners to adopt less clean energy sources, but that is not relevant here.

A quick search on [sciencedirect yields](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925517303505) several articles estimating the impact of online advertising; during the less-aggressive advertisement period of 2016, it was estimated to be approximately 106 TWh, the range being less certain, between 20 and 200 TWh estimated.  

[Another article demonstrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584923002252#fig3) the impact of advertisement on the power consumption of one's browser.
The reason for citing these is not a case of "whataboutism", but rather to give the reader perspective on the scales of power consumption that one refers to: the impact on global warming of blockchains is not an order of magnitude greater than the impact of online advertising; even the most [conservative estimates](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2023/bitcoin-electricity-consumption/)(in a non-peer-reviewed article) put Bitcoin at a grand total of 0.4% of global electricity consumption.  Let us estimate that the remaining cryptocurrencies account for 0.6% rounding the number to a solid one per cent.  This should give the reader the relative significance of focusing on cryptocurrencies as a driver of climate change.

It is not wrong to desire a more efficient system of consensus, one that would not require such an environmental impact, but attacks on the basis of environmental impact are largely not phrased in a fashion that is conducive to intelligent discourse; it is not "can you come up with a more efficient way of using bitcoin", it is more of a "you _dare_ use electricity, and do something useful with it!  Die infidel!".  This is largely the consequence of traditional media finding a scapegoat for natural, albeit unpleasant economic processes.

The reality of the situation is thus: the mining booms of yesteryear are unlikely to recur, the two will probably be the last.  The cryptocurrencies are moving towards more energy-efficient methods of consensus, such as proof-of-stake.  It is not likely that networks such as bitcoin will experience a rapid loss of clients, but the newer cryptos will be predominantly not proof-of-work.

## Security

Blockchains have a fundamentally different threat model to traditional _fiat_ currencies.  There is usually a single private key per identity.  I will cover what that means in a separate post, but for our purposes it is a piece of information, a number to be exact, that provides anyone who knows that piece of information access to perform actions on behalf of an identity.  As you can probably tell, the exclusiveness of this ability hinges on keeping the information a secret.
