# Emacs, the editor for the ages

This is a blog post dedicated to my, and many other people's favourite text editor. In-keeping with the theme of this section, I shall mainly focus on the misunderstood nature of the editor, and my personal connection to it. Most of it is going to be in the negative light, so it slightly edges out being posted in the Software section.

Without further ado.
