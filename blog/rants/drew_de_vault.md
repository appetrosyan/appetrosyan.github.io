# Drew DeVault's blog

I must preface this by pointing to something that should be blindingly obvious, but shall be taken out of context regardless. This is not a personal attack on Drew. I haven't met, him I don't have a problem with him other than the ideas that he has kindly put forward on his blog.

I think that this is a brave move, and most engineers would be wise to think of it as such; it is not easy to put your thoughts plainly in a piece of text, and to have your most unreasonable ideas be judged by an army of people who have the benefit of not having your day-to-day to be able to point at it.

In my defence most of what you'd find in this particular rubrick; rants, is going to be of a similar quality. However, that is no shield against criticism. Ideas need to be discussed, and improved upon. Bad ideas need to be discarded, good ideas -- put forward. So, without further "cover my arse" rhetoric, I'll dig into it.

## Attacks on Rust

There are multiple valid critiques of the language. Despite it being my main workhorse and something that I'm keenly interested in, I don't think that the language is perfect. I've seen valid critique of Rust from both "Rustaceans", whom I don't consider myself to be, from intellectuals with interesting worldviews, and from Drew.

He makes no secret of not liking it, as I will make no secret of my distrust towards Go. However, I mostly keep the critique of that language to a minimum. I may not agree with the trade-offs that it makes, but I respect that it's a language with a niche, and that to critique it for not conforming to my preconception of what constitutes good code, is just not coherent. You will not hear me criticise Go, the way Drew criticises Rust.

Case in point, Rust is not meant to be a C replacement, that's why a statement like "Rust is not a good C replacement" can only be replied to in one way: "no shit sherlock, a boot isn't a good replacement for a slipper either". Drew mostly echoes sentiments from C programmers that have nothing better to do other than complain that the world doesn't revolve around C as much as it used to. It still does to a large extent, and possibly will forever, inheriting most of its vocabulary and some of the technical debt, the same as humans have grown to use the Julian calendar. It doesn't mean that a more complex, more reliable language has no reason to exist and that some projects aren't better served by Rust instead of C.

So why oppose a language that will never ecnroach on the niche of your tool of choice? Well, possibly because of some well-intentioned comments by not so well-educated people. Drew is simply venting his frustration, and does so in a publically available format. There's nothing wrong with it in principle. In execution however, I'd point you to a few weak aspects of his argument.
