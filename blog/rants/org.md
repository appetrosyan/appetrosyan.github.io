# Org is not special

This article has spent a long time in the oven.  For a while I didn't even know that I wanted to publish it.

Org is considered one of the better lightweight markup languages and it certainly has merits.  It is widely considered a superior alternative to markdown, which if one thinks briefly, is not at all challenging to do.

Org is widely supported on Emacs.  It is pretty much unsupported on most platforms, including Visual Studio code, any of the IDEs, and while it is somewhat accurately interpreted by GitHub and its ilk, seldom if ever is offered on such a wide variety of platforms, as even the Emacs keybindings themselves.  There are few if any sites that would offer a collaborative editing environment for org.  There is a great deal of resistance towards adopting org as anything other than a curiosity.  Despite being loved and sometimes deified within Emacs and Emacs-adjacent communities, it is safe to say that org is nothing other than a curiosity.

So why then dedicate an entire article to it?  Because at a time not so long ago, I considered org to be the future of markup.  I considered it to be a far superior option to even heavyweight note-taking applications such as Notion, and was amused, nay indignant based on the idea that someone might build a note-taking, to-do application without supporting Org.  Thankfully there have been a few small incidents that have convinced me that Org should be left to the same fate as is ReStructured Text, ASCIIDoc, and `typst`.  

If you have some free time, don't invest it into making org better.  Borrow ideas from it, but don't invest into org itself.  What good there is about org.
