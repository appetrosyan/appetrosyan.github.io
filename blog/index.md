# About

This is my blog. My space. I think about a great many topics, and this is an almost raw unfiltered stream of those ideas. For a more curated, and much better researched material, you should look at my work for the Greybeard Entertainment.

This blog contains [rants](/blog/rants/index), some philosophy (TODO), some Arts (Music, Books, etc.) and a few things related to my trade: Science and Programming. These are additionally sub-categorised.
