This is a brief guide. 

If you're having trouble logging into Slack from a Chromium browser on Linux, just use Firefox.
The reason is kinda stupid to be honest.
Apparently KIO can change the case of the magic link, and firefox handles this correctly, while no other chromium based browser does that.
So the fix is to use Firefox.
