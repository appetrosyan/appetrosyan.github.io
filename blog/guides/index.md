# Guides

This is where I'll post information that some would consider actually useful.

This doesn't mean that I will not have opinionated segments. Just that the text isn't going to be mostly negative, it will focus on how to work around rather than the problem.

To anyone who feels that this might be excessive, I will try to reduce the amount of profanity, and/or link to a particular segment in the [rants](/blog/rants/index).

There is also a lot of room for improvement. Before I've figured out how to integrate any form of comments section, I'd advise you to email me directly.
