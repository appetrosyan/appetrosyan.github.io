# Getting comfortable with rejection and failure

This is a rather long-winded piece of wisdom that I have picked up from multiple sources.  It is meant largely for a few people in my immediate audience, whom I know and love and have every intention of helping along the way.

I have not learned this overnight.  _Errare humanum est_.  While I do not presume to know more than the other person, there are some strategies that I have found to be useful.  This article lists but a few of them.

## Why

Rejection is a natural part of trying.  Failure is a natural part of learning.  If you can do something without error from the first try and then iterate, there wasn't and isn't anything for you to learn.  If the odds of you being rejected are nil, so is perhaps the value of knocking on those doors.

Systematic rejection is a signal that you need to change your strategies.  Lack of rejection is a signal that you are not challenging yourself enough.  As a consequence, one must inure oneself from taking negative feedback too seriously, but at the same time to be attuned to it as well.  The negative feedback, as a rule, is the one thing that can help you significantly in your endeavours.

To illustrate why, allow me to illustrate this on a computer-science-y example.  Imagine that you're trying to search through a large array of numbers.  Some numbers signal a success, most others --- failure.

If the numbers are not sorted, the best strategy to find "success" is not any strategy in particular.  Any order of traversal is equally likely to yield the optimal outcome, and equally likely to be pathological.  That is to say, that some people are destined to early greatness, because they found a series of numbers that gave them an early leg up.  Some others must see more failure during their traversal.  Merely copying someone else's order yields no benefit, and the one true determiner of whether or not you find success, is how many numbers you are allowed to traverse before **game over**.  In this case, negative feedback is something to be endured, and is useful only in so much as to push one to move forwards.  This is the basis of what's known as a _Sigma grindset_, an unhealthy obsession with personal agency in these trying times.

Personal agency, ironically is the one thing that doesn't and cannot factor into this discussion.  By definition the some streaks will lose.  The _sigma grindset_ is good at ensuring that the people that could find "success" do, but it simply ignores one thing we _know_ about how the world works.  The numbers are _not_ random.

While being inured against the effects of negative feedback is certainly a useful skill to have regardless, it is also the only useful skill if the situation is completely unfair.  By contrast, if there is a way of obtaining the "success" numbers by exploiting some property of their ordering, ignoring feedback and moving on is not _as useful_.  One must be able to utilise negative feedback to thrive in a world where the numbers are ordered, but the "success" is hidden.

Case in point if one were to comb through a sorted array of numbers, there suddenly is an optimal search strategy.  Binary search kinda needs you to recognise two kinds of negative feedback and differentiate between the two.  Do you need to aim higher or lower?

## Constructive feedback

Do not be alarmed.  While stating that you should listen to constructive criticism is a clich√©, it makes sense for us to discuss.

Firstly, not many have internalised that constructive criticism should be viewed as a positive thing.  The set point for everything that we do is that it is perfect.  From that perspective, constructive critique is a step in the direction of more work, and you being less skilled than you thought you were.  For a beginner this is appropriate, but I have seen many who are late into their careers that run into this form of overly defensive stance.

If **any** form of constructive critique can set you off, there are deeper issues and a few important missing skills.

The first and most important is the _perfect until proven otherwise_ mindset.  Most greats, DaVinci notably, did not have that mindset, and I have reasonable suspicion that it is not itself a coincidence; it is useful skill to be able to see flaws in one's own work and work them out of the work.

Striving for perfection is important.  If you started out perfect, there is nothing for you to do.  If you came up with an architecture for a software project that turned out wrong, it's OK.  You are learning.  You will have peers which will in no uncertain terms explain why it was a bad idea.  But what must happen before any external criticism, is that you must yourself find the weaknesses of your work.  Subjectivity will prevent you from seeing flaws.  But it is an exercise that becomes easier with practice.

Others' constructive criticism is a means for oneself to calibrate their internal critic.  The amount of time it takes for an external observer to appraise your work is much greater than the amount of time that you yourself would take in order to see flaws and correct them.  Solely relying on external critics is not enough: you must be able to correct yourself quickly.

I would caution against perfectionism in these instances; I **myself** am not one, and I have often published work before it was ready.  I do recognise that the opposite is also true and also a problem.  Just keep in mind that it is a good idea to be pragmatic and be able to recognise not only perfection, but also instances wherein a work is good-enough.

## Pseudo-constructive feedback

This kind of feedback is an odd one.  While we would like to pretend that we all live in a world wherein everyone else is a perfectly rational individual with no inherent flaws and fundamentally no reasons to lie about the qualities of a work, this is not the case.

I differentiate this from constructive feedback, despite this being kind-of-a misnomer, because a few of my friends do not recognise it as different.  They view constructive critique as something that is constructive: in the sense that it tells you what you should do differently constructing a hypothetical better work that you could produce.
